#
# Prod is continuously deployed: the CI `deploy` job (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
# runs `deploy.sh prod` on every merge to main. This script is also the manual
# path for both environments; the *ceremony* lives in the SKILLS, not here:
#   /deploy-test  — low ceremony, pre-merge audition box (the private staging box).
#   /deploy-prod  — manual break-glass (CI down / forced redeploy off-pipeline).
# This script owns mechanics only — plus one hard safety guard: it refuses a PROD
# deploy from a dirty tree, so the public origin can never serve an unreviewed
# build even if the skill gate is bypassed. (CI checks out a clean tree, so the
# guard is a no-op there and a real backstop for manual laptop runs.)
#
# "What's live" is read straight off the running site: vite.config.ts bakes the
# commit rev into every asset filename (index.<REV>.js), so the deployed build is
# self-identifying and cannot drift. We curl it BEFORE (to show the true delta
# this deploy introduces, regardless of who deployed last or from where) and
# AFTER (to verify the right bundle landed). No stored deploy ref to fall stale.
