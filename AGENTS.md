# AI Agent Protocols for Ensemble

This document outlines mandatory protocols for AI agents (Jules, Gemini, etc.) working on the Ensemble codebase. Strict adherence is required to maintain system stability and test integrity.

## 1. Refactoring & File Movements
**Context:** Recent refactors caused widespread `TypeError` failures because test imports were not updated when functions moved from `soloist.js` to `theory-scales.js`.

*   **Global Search is Mandatory:** Before moving a function or constant, you MUST search the **entire** codebase (including `tests/` and `scripts/`) for usages.
    *   *Command:* `grep -r "functionName" .`
*   **Update Imports Immediately:** Do not rely on IDE auto-imports. Manually verify and update import paths in all consuming files.
*   **Verify Exports:** Ensure the function is properly exported from its new location and that there are no circular dependency issues.

## 2. Testing Mandates
**Context:** Logic changes (e.g., Music Theory improvements) were committed without updating the corresponding test expectations, leading to "false positive" failures where the code was correct but the test was outdated.

*   **Run Tests BEFORE Committing:** Always run `npm test` after your changes.
    *   If tests fail, **diagnose** whether the Code is broken or the Test is outdated.
*   **Test Globals Enabled:** The test environment (Vitest) is configured with `globals: true`. You can use `describe`, `it`, and `expect` without importing them.
*   **Logic Changes require Test Updates:** If you intentionally improve logic (e.g., "Use Lydian instead of Major for Jazz"), you **MUST** update the test expectations to reflect this new behavior.
    *   *Do not* leave tests failing.
    *   *Do not* revert correct logic to satisfy an outdated test. Update the test.
*   **New Features need New Tests:** If adding a new style (e.g., `Country`), add a specific test case for it (e.g., in `genre-expansion.test.js`) to verify unique behaviors.

## 3. Musical Logic & Hardcoding
**Context:** Some tests failed because they expected hardcoded integer arrays (e.g., `[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]`) that didn't account for context-aware changes (like `bandIntensity` or `genreFeel`).

*   **Avoid Fragile Assertions:** When possible, test for *properties* (e.g., "contains a minor 3rd") rather than exact array equality, unless verifying a specific strict algorithm.
*   **Respect "Smart" Context:** Remember that functions like `getScaleForChord` behave differently based on `groove.genreFeel`. Ensure your test setup mocks this state correctly.

## 4. Modular Architecture & State
**Context:** The codebase has transitioned from monolithic "God Classes" to domain-specific controllers and state slices.

*   **Respect State Boundaries:** State is decomposed into `public/state/`. Use the corresponding slice (e.g., `playback`, `arranger`, `instruments`) for reads.
*   **Dispatch for Writes:** ALWAYS use `dispatch(ACTIONS.TYPE, payload)` for writes. Never modify state objects directly.
*   **Hybrid Controller Pattern:**
    *   **UI Reads:** Use `useEnsembleState` hook to read state reactively.
    *   **Simple Writes:** Use `dispatch(ACTIONS.SET_PARAM, ...)` for simple value updates.
    *   **Complex Actions:** For actions with audio side effects (e.g., `togglePlay`, `setBpm`), import the specific controller function (e.g., from `scheduler-core.js` or `app-controller.js`) instead of dispatching raw actions.

## 5. Final Verification
*   **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` to catch unused imports or variables introduced during refactoring.
*   **Build:** Ensure the project builds/transpiles if applicable.
*   **State Integrity:** Verify that any changes to state schema are reflected in the domain slices in `public/state/`.
