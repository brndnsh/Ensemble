## Active references

- [`docs/design/chords-3.md`](design/chords-3.md) — keyboard/guitar player architecture, Acoustic pilot, and listening comparison.

- [`docs/design/`](design/) — living design docs for load-bearing models: [`design/songbook.md`](design/songbook.md) (durable chart documents, migration, and rollback), [`design/soloist-phrase-first.md`](design/soloist-phrase-first.md) (the soloist engine), [`design/timing-model.md`](design/timing-model.md) (the three-tier micro-timing law + the uniform-shift proof), and [`design/write-ownership.md`](design/write-ownership.md) (the write-ownership invariant — runtime never writes a document/preferences field; composes with the timing-model law).
- [`docs/guides/`](guides/) — implementation notes and reference guides.
- [`docs/guides/PERFORMANCE_GUIDELINES.md`](guides/PERFORMANCE_GUIDELINES.md) — hot-loop performance notes.
- [`docs/guides/musical-engine-patterns.md`](guides/musical-engine-patterns.md) — reusable recipes for generative-engine work (5 smells in critique tests, coordination patterns, loop-awareness, final-stage multiplier discipline, seeded determinism). Extracted from the completed musical audit.
- [`docs/guides/bundle-hygiene.md`](guides/bundle-hygiene.md) — reusable recipes for bundle-size work (budgets-as-baselines, DCE expectations, pre-flight grep for "orphaned" musical content, knip blind spots, code-splitting discipline, defense-in-depth hygiene). Extracted from the completed bundle audit.
- [`public/MANUAL.md`](../public/MANUAL.md) — in-app manual.
- [`tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md) — test-suite conventions.
- [`docs/FLAKY_TESTS.md`](FLAKY_TESTS.md) — registry of known-flaky tests, the four flake classes (unseeded-statistical / ordering-dependent / e2e-timing / slow-legitimate), and their fixes. Diagnose new flakes with the `/flake` skill.

## Historical references

Frozen archives — historical context only. The live tracker is GitHub issues (see CLAUDE.md § Work Pipeline); do not pick up work from these.

- [`docs/archive/`](archive/) — completed reports and archived audits.
- [`docs/synth-audit/`](synth-audit/) — **⛔ frozen archive** of the synth-realism audit (7 epics, shipped). Live synth work is GitHub issues, Track `synth`.
- [`docs/audit/FOLLOWUPS.md`](audit/FOLLOWUPS.md) — **⛔ frozen archive** of the musical-audit follow-up backlog. Live follow-ups are `finding`/`backlog` issues on the GitHub tracker. The audit cycle itself is archived at [`docs/archive/musical-audit-2026-05/`](archive/musical-audit-2026-05/).
- [`docs/TECH_DEBT.md`](TECH_DEBT.md) — historical May 2026 state-discipline audit snapshot; its remaining mutation finding was superseded by the detached-render exception in `CLAUDE.md`.
