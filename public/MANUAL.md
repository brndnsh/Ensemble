# Ensemble: Getting Started & Guide

Welcome to Ensemble, your AI-powered virtual band. Whether you're practicing soloing, writing a new song, or just jamming, this guide will help you get the most out of the engine.

## 🚀 The 30-Second Jam
Everything happens on one surface — the chart is always in front of you.
1.  **Choose a Band Feel:** In the **Live mix** rail, open the genre chooser and pick a feel.
2.  **Type Chords:** Tap **✏️ Edit** in the topbar (or press `E`) to unlock the chart, then enter your progression (e.g., `C | F G`).
3.  **Press Start:** Hit play — the chart re-locks and the band begins playing immediately.
4.  **Keep Going:** Tweak the genre, the per-instrument mix, the key, or the tempo on the fly — the music never stops, and nothing covers the chart.
*✨ **Pro Tip:** The `⋯` overflow menu in the topbar holds Library, Settings, and the Manual — all without leaving the lead sheet. Share is a button right in the topbar, and transpose lives in the key menu.*

## 🎹 Common Workflows

### Understanding the Surface
Ensemble is a single chart-first surface — there are no separate views to switch between. Everything radiates out from the lead sheet:
- **The Chart (center):** Your lead sheet for chords and form. It's **locked by default** — your music stand. Tap **✏️ Edit** (or press `E`) to unlock it for writing; the lock re-engages when you press play. While locked, the currently-playing chord is highlighted as the band moves through the form.
- **The Topbar:** The transport (play/stop, BPM, tap tempo) sits on the left; key, time signature, and the song seed (🎲) in the center; quick actions — Library, Edit, Share, and the **🌈 Visualizer** — on the right. The `⋯` overflow holds Library, Settings, and the Manual. (Transpose lives in the key menu; the song seed 🎲 sits in the center.)
- **The Live Mix Rail:** The band, along one edge. See which of the five instruments are active, toggle each on or off, and open per-instrument settings (register, style, drum preset, trading). A genre chooser at the top sets the whole-band feel and intensity.
- **🌈 Visualizer:** A full-screen overlay with a real-time piano-roll of every instrument, color-coded by track and chord tone. Open it any time; playback keeps running underneath.
- **On a phone:** the rail collapses into a bottom action bar — 🎚️ Mix · 📤 Share · 🌈 Visuals — and the topbar reflows so the chart stays front and center.

### "I want to practice soloing"
Ensemble is built for improvisation.
- **Trade Mode:** In the **Live mix** rail, open the Soloist settings and enable **Trade Sections**. The band will play for one section, then hand off the lead to you for the next.
- **Status Indicator:** Watch the Soloist state pill in the rail. **On** means the AI is active, and **Queued** means the soloist is waiting for the next trading section.
- **Soloist Performance:** Press `S` to launch **Soloist Performance**. This lets you play the soloist instrument manually using your keyboard, with notes automatically mapped to the current and upcoming chords.
- **Play along on a real keyboard:** Plug in a MIDI keyboard, then in **Settings** enable **Play-Along (Note Input)** and choose your device. The band becomes your backing group while *you* take an instrument in the room — the hands-on inverse of Trade Mode.

### "I want to woodshed a section"
Drill one tricky part until it's under your fingers — the **section label** on the chart is the control, and it works mid-play.
- **Jump or loop:** Tap any section label to open the practice popover. **▶ Start from here** jumps the band to that section; **🔁 Loop this section** arms a repeat of just that part (no auto-play — it waits for you).
- **Tempo ramp (the drill):** Once you're looping, the popover expands to a tempo ramp. Set **Start at** — a percentage of your goal tempo, so you begin slow — and **Climb** — how many BPM to add each pass. The band starts under tempo and speeds up a notch every loop until you're at speed; the BPM readout shows a ramp indicator while it climbs.
- **Release:** Reopen the label and hit **⏹ Stop looping** to drop back to the full form at your set tempo.

### "I want the soloist to sound more intentional"
The AI Soloist uses a **Dynamic Head** system to provide thematic direction to each session. Every time you press play, the soloist generates a unique "seed melody" that fits your specific chord progression.
- **Chorus 1 (The Head):** The soloist plays the seed melody clearly and accurately to establish the "song" for the session.
- **Chorus 2 (Evolution):** The soloist adds stylistic embellishments like slides, grace notes, and "blues curls" around the seed notes.
- **Chorus 3+ (Improvisation):** The soloist begins to improvise freely, but still maintains a slight "magnetic pull" toward the original theme, ensuring the performance feels connected and intentional rather than random.

### "I want to play the drums manually"
If you want to take over the rhythm section or just troubleshoot the kit:
- **Drum Pad:** Press `D` to open **Drum Performance Mode** directly.
- **Performance Mode:** When the drum pad is open, the automatic drum patterns stop, giving you full manual control.
- **Ergonomic Layout:** The pads are mapped to your home row:
    - **Kick:** `Space`
    - **Pocket (Left Hand):** `F` (Snare), `D` (Rim)
    - **Pulse (Right Hand):** `J` (Hi-Hat), `K` (Ride), `L` (Open Hat)
    - **Fills:** `R`, `T`, `Y` (Toms) and `U` (Crash)

### "I'm writing a new song"
The chart is locked by default — your music stand. Tap **🔒 Edit** in the topbar (or press `E`) to unlock and start editing; lock re-engages automatically when you hit play.
- **🎲 Surprise me:** Roll a random arrangement in your current key, pick a curated template, or load a chord-progression preset. One button replaces the older Library + Generate Song + Inspiration Hub entry points.
- **Tap-a-chord:** While the chart is locked, tap any chord to swap it via a popover — no keyboard needed.
- **Per-section direction:** Each section header shows a dynamic-mark button (`pp` / `mp` / `mf` / `ff`) and five instrument dots (D · B · C · H · S) — tap to dial intensity per-section or mute an instrument just inside that section.

### "I want to record into my DAW"
Ensemble talks MIDI in **both** directions — drive your DAW with the band, or play into Ensemble from a controller.
- **MIDI out:** Go to **Settings > Enable Web MIDI Output** to stream the band's performance to Logic, Ableton, or hardware synths as a high-precision MIDI controller.
- **MIDI in (play-along):** In the same panel, enable **Play-Along (Note Input)** and pick your device to play an instrument *into* Ensemble while the band backs you.
- **Latency:** Use the **Latency Compensation** slider to perfectly sync Ensemble's timing with your DAW.
- **Automation:** The AI sends **Expression (CC 11)** and **Modulation (CC 1)** data automatically, making your virtual instruments sound "alive."

## 🧠 Understanding the Band

### The Conductor (Intensity & Complexity)
These controls are some of the most powerful ways to shape the band:
- **Intensity:** Controls the band's energy. At 0.1, the drummer might just use cross-sticks; at 0.9, they'll be playing heavy crashes and busy fills.
- **Complexity:** Controls "how much" the band plays. Higher values add jazzy chord extensions, walking bass variations, and rhythmic "pockets."

### Smart Interaction
The virtual band members "listen" to each other to coordinate their performance in real-time:
- **Yielding:** When you activate the AI **Soloist**, the Chords and Bass instruments automatically simplify their parts to give the lead voice more "spectral space."
- **Pocket:** The Bass is hard-wired to the Kick Drum. They coordinate to always land on the "1" together for a professional, tight low-end.

## 🎼 Arranger & Chord Notation

### Standard Notation
The arranger supports standard notation formats like **Absolute** (`Cmaj7`), **Roman** (`Imaj7`), and **Nashville** (`1maj7`). 

### Measures & Beats
Use the pipe (`|`) character to separate measures. Chords are distributed evenly across the bar:
- `C | F G |` = 1 bar of C (4 beats), 1 bar of F then G (2 beats each).

### Common Song Forms
Standard forms like the **12-Bar Blues** can be written cleanly using measure markers:
- `I7 | I7 | I7 | I7 | IV7 | IV7 | I7 | I7 | V7 | IV7 | I7 | V7`
- *✨ **Pro Tip:** Each line in the text area is treated as a continuation of the progression.*

## 🛠 Appendix: Engine Details
The following information is generated directly from the Ensemble engine to ensure accuracy.

### Available Smart Genres
{{GENRE_TABLE}}

### Instrument Styles

In **Jazz** or **Acoustic**, open Chords settings and choose **Modern jazz piano**
for connected chord voicings and light right-hand answers over held lower notes.
Leave Sound on **Auto** to use Acoustic Grand Piano when installed. Density
changes the voicing's fullness without adding more rhythmic attacks. Try
`Dm7 | G7 | Cmaj7 | Cmaj7` with the soloist off and play your own melody above it.

Choose **Open modal piano** for wider voicings and broad, unhurried statements
with an occasional right-hand answer. Fourths add space where they fit the chart;
the defining chord notes stay clear. Start at Standard density, or use Thin for
less color. Try `Dm11 | G13 | Cmaj9 | Cmaj9`, then compare
`Cmaj7 | C7 | Cm7 | Cm7` to hear how each chord keeps its identity. With Bass off,
the piano supplies the root and any written slash bass. Sound follows the same
Auto/pinned choice as Modern jazz piano.
