 * why (#1257): `swingSub` is a **string** ('8th' | '16th') — the swing-base `<select>`

 * has only ever been `ss: groove.swingSub`). So *every* share link landed the number
 * 8 and locked the session to 8th-note swing. Per the repo's swing doctrine the grid
 * (8th vs 16th subdivision) *is* the feel, so a shared Funk or Neo-Soul session
 * reached the recipient with a different pocket than the sender heard. The swing-base
 * dropdown also showed an unmatched value, so it was visibly desynced from what was
 * playing — wrong, but not literally invisible.
 *
 * Used by **both** readers on purpose. The share path is where the corruption
 * originated, but `saveCurrentState()` then persisted the poisoned value and the
 * persist path passed it straight back through unguarded, so anyone who had already
 * opened a share link stayed stuck at 8th-note swing on every subsequent boot, with

 * one: it is `Record<string, number>`, it crosses to the logic worker via
 * `getSyncState()`, and `drums-tick.ts` used to read it as
 * `groove.sectionSeedMap[sectionId] || 0` — a plain-literal truthiness lookup, so
 * on a prototype-bearing object a section id of `'constructor'` yielded the
 * `Object` constructor *as a seed index*, and any non-numeric value flowed into
 * the drum-motif index arithmetic as `NaN`. (That read is type-checked as of this
 * change; the shape validation here is the other half.)
 *
 * Deliberately NOT null-prototyped, though that is the reflex the rest of this
 * file would suggest. It would be theatre here: this map's prototype is rebuilt as
 * a plain object twice over before any consumer sees it — `grooveReducer` assigns a
 * fresh `{}` on `SET_SONG_SEED` (which `state-effects.ts` fires on the FIRST
 * `TOGGLE_PLAY`, because `randomizeSeed` defaults true) and on `RESET_STATE`, and
 * `toRaw` in `worker-client.ts` copies every synced object into a plain `{}` before
 * `postMessage`. A null prototype would also silently drop the field out of
 * deepsignal's reactive graph, since its proxy predicate is
 * `SUPPORTED.has(value.constructor)` and a null-prototype object has no
 * `.constructor`.
 *
 * What actually holds, at three layers: the KEYS are rejected at the source
 * (`isSafeSectionId` above, so no section id can name a prototype member), the
 * VALUES are filtered here to finite numbers, and each of the four engine reads
 * type-checks what it gets back (`groove-engine.ts`, `drums-tick.ts`, and both
 * reads in `conductor.ts`). That combination reaches the worker; a prototype guard
 * on this object cannot.
 *
 * The 1000-entry cap mirrors `validateSections`' 500-section cap with headroom:
 * this map is keyed by section id, so it cannot legitimately outgrow the chart by
 * much. It bounds the SYNCED SNAPSHOT, not the parse — `JSON.parse` has already
 * materialized the whole payload by the time we get here.
