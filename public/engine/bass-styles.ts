 * #1335: bass styles whose idiom is deliberately EVEN — `bass-engine.ts`'s
 * generic odd-beat velocity accent (`intBeat % 2 === 1 ? 1.15 : 1.0`) would
 * misrepresent these idioms if it reached them, so it's suppressed to flat
 * 1.0 for these style ids. Absence (any other, or a future style) means
 * "accented," the historical default — never silent.
 *
 * The gate is applied once, at `bass-engine.ts`'s `const velocity`
 * definition — so it covers every consumer of that shared value: the
 * `result()` closure's `velocityParam * velocity * bassEnvelope` product
 * (#941 removed the `intensityFactor` term that used to sit in it — the
 * lane's macro swell is now the single downstream `bassMacroGain`, see
 * `velocity-shaping.ts`) (used by every `getBassNoteStyle` branch, including
 * `quarter`'s own — search `style === 'quarter'` inside that function, it
 * DOES have dedicated handling, contrary to an earlier draft of this
 * comment), the two return sites in `bass-engine.ts` that bypass `result()`
 * entirely, and the generic candidate-picking fallback quarter also reaches
 * for most positions. One gate site, not a per-branch patch.
 *
 * 'quarter' (jazz walking): a walking line's drive comes from note-length
 * consistency and the quarter pulse, not level accents — a systematic
 * backbeat accent is a rock/backbeat trait, off-idiom here.
 *
 * 'bossa': `getBassNoteStyle`'s bossa branch (below) never reaches the
 * OUTER generic candidate-picking code in `bass-engine.ts` (its one
 * `return null;`, for a step outside its four foundation positions, is dead
 * in production — `checkBassActiveStyle`'s bossa gate only ever calls
 * `getBassNote` on exactly those same four positions: 0/6/8/14 in 4/4, the
 * pulse-start/pickup slots in compound). BUT every one of those foundation
 * notes is built by calling `result(...)` — the SAME `result` closure
 * `getBassNote` defines and passes down as a context argument, which still
 * multiplies `velocityParam * velocity * bassEnvelope` —
 * so the shared `velocity` (this gate) DOES reach every bossa note, just
 * through that shared closure rather than the generic fallback. Verified
 * empirically: pre-fix, the "& of 2/4" anticipation notes (odd `intBeat`,
 * authored quieter, 1.0) picked up the spurious ×1.15
 * accent while the "1/3" downbeat anchors (even `intBeat`, authored louder,
 * 1.1) did not — inverting bossa's intended
 * downbeat-anchor-over-anticipation hierarchy. (The tokens carried
 * `+ intensity*0.15` / `+ intensity*0.1` slopes at the time, so the pair also
 * saturated `BASS_VELOCITY_DOMAIN_MAX` and read equal above roughly intensity
 * 0.88 — never this gate's business, and removed outright by #941.) This gate
 * restores the ordering.
 *
 * See also `GESTURE_ACCENT_BASS_STYLES` below: a SECOND set feeding the same
 * gate, for styles suppressed because they author their own per-gesture
 * dynamics rather than because their idiom is flat. Two sets, one gate — the
 * reason a style is listed is the part worth keeping separate.

/**
 * #1342: bass styles that author their OWN per-gesture velocity for every note
 * they emit, and therefore opt out of `bass-engine.ts`'s generic per-BEAT
 * velocity accent (`intBeat % 2 === 1 ? 1.15 : 1.0`) the same way
 * `EVEN_ACCENT_BASS_STYLES` does — but for a different musical reason, which is
 * why it's a separate set rather than a new member of that one. Those styles are
 * suppressed because their idiom is dynamically FLAT (a walking line's drive is
 * note-length, not level). Funk is the opposite: it is the most accented idiom
 * in the file. Its accents just aren't METRIC.
 *
 * 'funk': every note the funk branch emits already carries an authored
 * velocity naming the GESTURE that produced it — thumb slap on
 * The One (`BASS_AUTHORING_CEILING` = 1.25, `bass-engine.ts`'s
 * `stepInChord === 0` early return), secondary slap on beat 3 (`slapVel`),
 * the "and" pop (`popVel`), the
 * high-complexity "a" pop, hammer-on, chord-change approach,
 * and the dead-note chuck. The canonical rung table lives at the top of the
 * `style === 'funk'` branch below — read it there, not here, so there is one
 * copy to keep true. (Every rung carried an identical
 * `+ intensity*0.2` macro slope until #941 moved the lane's swell into the
 * single `bassMacroGain` term, and #947 then re-spaced the flat rungs downward
 * so the ladder is audible at verse intensity as well as chorus.)
 * That ladder IS funk's accent map. Layering a
 * blanket per-beat multiplier on top of it scales whatever gesture happens to
 * fall inside the accented beat — a muted 0.5 ghost chuck on a beat-2 16th gets
 * the same +15% as the pop, which is a category error: a dead note is quiet by
 * definition. (#942 review: making "every note" true took two style-agnostic
 * early returns in `bass-engine.ts` as well — the kick-lock branch now lets
 * funk's chord start fall through to the authored slap instead of a generic
 * lock level, and the section-anticipation walk-in carries its own authored
 * lead-in token instead of the `velocity`-derived product this exemption zeroed.)
 *
 * Two shapes were considered (#1342 is explicitly a design call):
 *   (a) move funk to a beats-1&3 accent set, so the generic metric weight
 *       reinforces the slap positions instead of fighting them; or
 *   (b) exempt funk from the generic accent entirely. THIS is what shipped.
 *
 * (b) won on three counts. First, funk's accents are SYNCOPATED by definition —
 * the weight lands on The One and on the offbeat pops, not on a fixed
 * strong-beat grid, so ANY per-beat multiplier is the wrong instrument; (a)
 * would only move the ghost-chuck category error from beats 2&4 onto 1&3.
 * Second, it is redundant: The One and the beat-3 slap already carry their own
 * authored levels (#1334, re-spaced to a full 0.95 dB apart by #947) so The One
 * stays the louder of the two — a further ×1.15 on both preserves nothing and
 * buys nothing. Third — the decisive one, measured by building (a) and running the
 * suite against it rather than reasoning about it: stacking a ×1.15 on The One
 * ON TOP of its own 1.25 token rails it against
 * `BASS_VELOCITY_DOMAIN_MAX` a whole intensity band earlier, which flattens the
 * chorus. Under (a) the #1331 chorus-hierarchy metric drops to a 0.81 dB spread
 * over 4 rendered levels — RED against that test's own 1.0 dB floor — and the
 * macro swell falls from +6.03 dB to +5.42 dB; The One also stops being
 * STRICTLY the loudest note from i≈0.6 up instead of i≈0.7. Under (b) the same
 * metrics improve on the status quo (1.37 dB over 5 levels, modal share 81% →
 * 71%): removing a multiplier that was pinning notes to the rail buys back
 * dynamic resolution the whole bar was losing. (a) would have fixed the
 * ordering by making everything else quieter relative to a railed downbeat;
 * (b) fixes it by letting the authored ladder through untouched.
 *
 * What funk keeps is `bass-engine.ts`'s `bassEnvelope` (#1006): +5% on the
 * downbeat and bar midpoint, −7% on the step right after, tapering. That is a
 * phrasing swell an order of magnitude gentler than a 15% level accent, and it
 * anchors beats 1 and 3 — with it, and with the generic accent gone, the
 * rendered order in a funk bar is The One on top, then the "and" pops and the
 * beat-3 slap interleaved by that envelope (a pop leaning INTO a strong beat
 * edges the slap; a pop landing just AFTER one sits under it), then the fingered
 * lead-ins, then the "a" pop and hammer-on, then the chuck — the authored ladder
 * read back with only phrasing shading on it, instead of a metric multiplier
 * re-sorting it.
 * Guarded by `tests/standards/funk-bass-critique.test.ts` (#1342, #947).
 *
 * Before adding a style here, check it actually authors a velocity on EVERY
 * return path — a style that leaves some notes at `result()`'s default 1.0 needs
 * the metric accent to have any dynamic shape at all. That audit must include
 * `bass-engine.ts`'s style-AGNOSTIC early returns (kick-lock, section
 * anticipation, the quiet-offbeat ghost), which emit for a style without ever
 * entering its own branch — two of the three bit funk (#942 review).

    // anything. Post-#941 these are FLAT articulation tokens (no intensity
    // term) — the lane's macro swell is `bassMacroGain`'s single downstream job
    // — so the rung-to-rung spacing below is intensity-INVARIANT and is the only
    // dynamic contrast funk has inside a bar.
    //
    //   1.25  primary slap family — The One (thumb slap, `bass-engine.ts`) and
    //         the "and" pop (`popVel`). Both sit ON `BASS_AUTHORING_CEILING`.
    //   1.12  secondary slap — beat 3 (`slapVel`).            (-0.95 dB)
    //   1.02  fingered lead-ins — the section walk-in (`bass-engine.ts`) and the
    //         chord-change harmonic approach.                 (-0.81 dB)
    //   0.92  ornament band — the "a" 16th flick-pop …        (-0.90 dB)
    //   0.90  … and the hammer-on, a hair under it (no right-hand strike at all).
    //   0.50  chuck / dead note — the ghost lane, a separate layer.  (-5.1 dB)
    //
    // why this shape: #942 fixed the ORDER of funk's accents but left every full
    // note inside ~0.6 dB rendered at verse intensity — one dynamic level to a
    // listener, i.e. the bar had a hierarchy on paper and none in the air. The
    // rungs above are the real gesture classes of slap technique separated by an
    // audible step: a thumb slap and a pop are struck hard; the beat-3 slap is
    // the answering thump, not the anchor; a fretted lead-in has no percussive
    // attack at all; the 16th ornaments are flicks the hand never gets full
    // leverage on; the chuck carries no pitch. Widening had to go DOWNWARD — 1.25 is
    // `BASS_AUTHORING_CEILING` and the top of the ladder was already there.
    //
    // why The One and the pop share the top rung: "on The One" is a STRUCTURAL
    // idea, not a loudness ranking — in real slap bass the pop is very often the
    // brightest event in the bar. The One stays nominally on top only via the
    // genre-neutral metric envelope (+5% on the downbeat vs +2.5% into it), which
    // is ordering, not dominance, and that is the intended contract (#947
