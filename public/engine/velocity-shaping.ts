 * The one authority for a velocity curve that live playback and the `.mid`

 *
 * Sibling in spirit to `mute-contract.ts`: a note's generated `velocity` is
 * reinterpreted independently on several paths (the synth voice, the sampled
 * voice, live MIDI-out, and the `.mid` exporter — see `public/engine/CLAUDE.md`
 * §7 for the same hazard on bend gestures), and every time a curve got
 * copy-pasted into two of them they drifted apart while the comment claiming
 * they matched outlived the fact. #1322 audited the two curves the exporter
 * claimed to "match live" and found BOTH claims false, in different ways.
 *
 * #1325 resolved the **soloist** one, below. It deliberately did NOT resolve the
 * bass one: the obvious fix (give the exporter live's `[0,1]` clamp) turned out
 * to propagate a truncation rather than share a curve, and "match live" is
 * ill-defined for bass because the synth and sampled voices disagree with each
 * other. The reasoning and the measurements live at the bass branch in
 * `_writeNotesToTrack` (`midi-worker-logic.ts`).
 *
 * #1331 closed that gap from the other end: rather than teaching the exporter
 * live's truncation, live dropped it. The bass velocity **domain** is now
 * `[0, 1.5]` on every path — the same domain `normalizeMidiVelocity` already
 * used — and `bassVelocityToAmplitude` (below) is live's shared law on it.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free (pure math, no state import) so both the
 * main-thread audio scheduler and the worker-side exporter can call it.

 * The soloist's band-intensity swell: how much louder the lead plays as the
 * conductor drives the band harder.
 *
 * Musical intent: a soloist is the lane that *responds* to the room — laid back
 * under a quiet verse, leaning in over a shout chorus. The `0.5` floor / `0.9`
 * span are the numbers the `.mid` exporter has always written; #1325's decision
 * was that the exported dynamics were RIGHT and live playback was the side
 * missing them, so live adopted these rather than the export flattening to
 * live's un-swelled velocity.
 *
 * **Apply this as a FINAL-STAGE multiplier**, after the accent / conductor /
 * polyphony factors — per CLAUDE.md's weight-tuning rule. Folded into one of
 * those terms it washes out against the others.
 *
 * **The live curve this participates in is QUADRATIC, and that is intended.**
 * This function is linear, but it is not the only intensity→velocity term in the
 * live path: `playback.conductorVelocity` is itself `0.7 + bandIntensity * 0.45`
 * (`applyConductor` in `conductor.ts`, running every step while `autoIntensity`
 * is on). The live soloist multiplies by both, so the effective curve is
 * `(0.7 + 0.45·I) × (0.5 + 0.9·I)` = `0.35 + 0.855·I + 0.405·I²` — live swings
 * 0.35x–1.61x where the export swings only this function's 0.50x–1.40x.
 *
 * That accelerating shape is a feature, not the double-application bug it can
 * look like: across the conductor's realistic operating band the lead's dynamic
 * range goes from ~4.1 dB to ~8.7 dB, which is closer to how a horn or lead
 * guitar actually plays a climax — you don't ramp linearly into a peak, you
 * commit late. **Don't "fix" the linearity here**; a fourth term stacked on top
 * is the real risk. The live-vs-export range divergence is a known, accepted
 * open question (the exporter never reads `conductorVelocity`, though it IS
 * synced to the worker) — filed, not forgotten.
 *
 * @param bandIntensity `playback.bandIntensity`, 0..1 — production default 0.35
 *   (gain 0.815), floored at 0.01 by the auto-conductor and at 0.3–0.45 by most
 *   genres, so the 0.5 gain at a true 0 is a bound, not a resting seat. Absent
 *   or non-finite → 0.5; production always sends a real number, so that fallback
 *   is a test-shape affordance rather than a live path. Guarded with
 *   `Number.isFinite` rather than `??` because this is the first term in the live
 *   soloist velocity product that can carry non-finiteness, and
 *   `dispatchMidiSoloist` → `normalizeMidiVelocity` would pass a NaN straight
 *   through as a MIDI data byte (the synth voices guard, MIDI-out doesn't). Same
 *   guard shape as `soloistBrightnessDrive` in `synth-soloist.ts`.

 * The BASS lane's macro dynamic law (#941) — how much louder the bass plays as
 * the conductor drives the band harder, and the **only** intensity-driven term
 * left in the bass velocity product.
 *
 * Before #941 the bass stacked THREE multiplicative intensity terms: an
 * intensity-scaled style token (`bass-styles.ts`, e.g. `1.0 + intensity*0.25`),
 * a generic `intensityFactor` (`0.6 + intensity*0.7`, `bass-engine.ts`), and the
 * band-wide `conductorVelocity`. Their product railed against whatever ceiling
 * existed — at `bandIntensity` 1.0 EVERY style's downbeat came out at the same
 * clamped 1.725, so the chorus erased both the accent hierarchy and the
 * inter-style dynamic character it had spent three terms building. #941's
 * decision: the conductor owns the lane's macro law, style tokens go back to
 * expressing RELATIVE ARTICULATION only (accent vs ghost vs base), and
 * `intensityFactor` is gone.
 *
 * **Apply this as a FINAL-STAGE multiplier, DOWNSTREAM of the engine's
 * `BASS_VELOCITY_DOMAIN_MAX` clamp** — same placement as `soloistIntensityGain`,
 * and load-bearing for the same reason the pre-#941 `conductorVelocity` was: the
 * authored articulation vocabulary already reaches ~1.5 on its own (a 1.25 slap
 * token × a 1.15 accent × a 1.05 envelope), so a macro swell folded INSIDE that
 * clamp has nowhere to go and re-creates the flat chorus this issue removed.
 * `BASS_AUTHORING_CEILING`-to-`BASS_VELOCITY_DOMAIN_MAX` is only ×1.2 of
 * headroom (1.6 dB) — a 6–8 dB swell provably does not fit in it.
 *
 * why `0.40 + 1.10·I` (×3.75 low-to-high) rather than the conductor's own
 * ×1.64: the bass amplitude law (`bassVelocityToAmplitude`, below) is
 * COMPRESSIVE — `sqrt` under unity — so an authored ×1.64 renders as barely
 * 2.6 dB on this lane, inaudible as a macro arc. ×3.75 authored renders as
 * **+6.3 to +7.0 dB** across the bass style vocabulary (measured through the
 * real product path; the funk downbeat lands at +7.0 dB from i=0.1 to i=1.0).
 * That is the intended lane swell: the bass swells with the band but stays
 * deliberately compressed against the soloist's arc, whose live curve
 * (`conductorVelocityFor × soloistIntensityGain`) swings ×4.6 and accelerates
 * quadratically. The bass anchors the mix floor — it should never be the lane
 * that disappears in a verse or the lane that leads a climax.
 *
 * why LINEAR (where the soloist's live curve is quadratic): the soloist "commits
 * late" into a peak, which is what the accelerating shape encodes. A rhythm
 * section's job is the opposite — a steady, predictable proportional response
 * the rest of the band can lean on. One term, one slope.
 *
 * The floor/span are pinned to the conductor's own so the ownership is auditable
 * rather than coincidental: `0.40 = 0.7 × 4/7` and `1.10 = 0.45 × 22/9` are not
 * meaningful ratios, so the two curves are related by INTENT (same input, same
 * "band leans in" gesture) and calibrated independently — mid-intensity is the
 * calibration point. At `I = 0.5` this returns 0.95, which holds every style's
 * rendered mid-intensity level within ±0.5 dB of its pre-#941 value (measured
 * across rock / funk / jazz-walking / bossa / metal downbeats and backbeats;
 * most land within ±0.31 dB, the outlier is rock's downbeat at +0.43 dB where
 * the old chain stacked two sub-unity mid-intensity terms) — under the ~1 dB
 * JND for a low-register tone in a mix. The un-stacking is therefore audible as
 * restored dynamic RANGE, not as a level change.
 *
 * @param bandIntensity `playback.bandIntensity`, 0..1. Non-finite → 0.5 (the
 *   production default band), matching `soloistIntensityGain`'s guard: this is
 *   the first term in the live bass velocity product that can carry
 *   non-finiteness, and `dispatchMidiBass` → `normalizeMidiVelocity` would pass a
