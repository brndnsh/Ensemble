/**
 * Phrase-first soloist engine — THE soloist engine
 * (docs/design/soloist-phrase-first.md).
 *
 * `tick-logic.ts` calls this every tick. It began as a parallel, flag-gated path
 * built up layer-by-layer alongside the old `getSoloistNote`; once it became the
 * default the toggle was retired, and epic #10 (#865) DELETED the legacy engine
 * outright — this is now the only soloist generator.
 *
 * **Contract:** `null` | a note object (`{ midi, velocity, durationSteps,
 * timingOffset, … }`, `freq` is derived downstream), and it maintains
 * `soloist.session.phrasing.isResting` each tick (tick-logic publishes it to the
 * coordination context so bass/chords/harmony know whether the lead is breathing).
 * The positional argument list is inherited from the retired `getSoloistNote` (some
 * params are vestigial — see the signature).
 *
 * **Build status — 2c (apex reach + recurring peaks):** on top of 2b (theme +
 * breath + arc + chord-tone landing + cumulative development with theme return),
 * the climb now has a *destination*: the highest note of EACH development-cycle
 * window (its local peak) LANDS on a **money note** — a strong key tone a
 * third-to-sixth above — whenever it sounds, so the lead reaches a resolved
 * signature peak roughly once per cycle (~24 bars), not once per macro-form
 * (design §9). Build 2d adds expression as a lyrical FLURRY around each peak — a
 * whole-step scoop UP INTO the money note, lighter scoops on ~half the nearby
 * notes, and vibrato on any held note in the zone — clustered into a burst, with
 * the long stretch between peaks left clean so the flurries have space (§10).
 *
 * **Build 3 (voice-leading — the keystone, §5):** the body of the line now plays
 * THROUGH the changes. Strong beats (authored meter-group starts) are TARGETS — a
 * non-chord-tone there is pulled onto a guide tone (3rd/7th), while a note already
 * on a chord tone is left as the melody states it; the weak step before a target
 * steps diatonically INTO it (a leading tone), and a chord change on that beat is
 * anticipated across the barline. Guide tones come from chord QUALITY (shared
 * `chordTargetTones`), robust to rootless comp voicings. (Idiom-specific chromatic
 * enclosures / bebop passing scales are a later slice — §8.) Every
 * emitted note's duration is clamped to the next note that sounds, so the
 * monophonic lead never overruns its successor. Still to come: op variety (inversion,
 * displacement), a stepwise run-up into the apex, voice-leading targeting on
 * weak beats, then full expression (bends/vibrato, sparingly). With no seed it
 * rests (returns null) — a guard test proves every canonical genre seeds non-empty
 * for a real chart, so that rest path is unreachable in normal playback.

// #1006 — within-phrase velocity envelope test seam (§4.6). The envelope is a pure

 * The seed note that OWNS a step: a planned Q&A cadence first, then the hook, else

 *
 * #1162 — array order at a step is an accident of seed post-processing, not a
 * musical ranking. The flair pass's Device-1 dotted split (`soloist-seeder.ts`)
 * re-articulates a long note by emitting its second half at
 * `step + stepsPerBeat * 1.5` with no occupancy check; that fragment carries the
 * PARENT's pitch and is produced while the parent is being processed, so it sits
 * ahead of a cadence that lands on the same step. (The split guard `!qaRole` only
 * protects the note being split, not wherever its tail lands.) Measured at ~1 seed
 * in 90 across every preset x 10 genres x both modes; always a `durationSteps: 2`
 * fragment in front of the cadence, never a hook.
 *
 * Reading the role off the fragment cost the cadence both its pinned pitch and its
 * density-gate exemption — so a question hang could be gated to silence outright —
 * while `emitsAt`, `isAnchor` and `computeQaWindows` all scan every note at the step
 * and still expected it to sound. This is the one selector they now share, so the
 * live emit and its lookahead paths cannot drift apart again.
 *
 * Cadence outranks hook because the cadence has a CROSS-LANE contract: the comper
 * echoes the question's own pitch class via `computeQaWindows`, so losing it makes
 * another instrument answer a tone the lead never played. A hook loss is contained
 * inside this lane. (They can't collide in practice — the hook lives at a block's
 * measure 0, cadences at the end of each half.)
