// and these specific pitch classes (relative to root) are the alterations to lean on".
// Kept exhaustive and explicit rather than parsing the chord symbol — the chord
// engine already canonicalizes quality strings; we map each known altered quality
// to the set of *altered extensions* (NOT the chord tones themselves) so the
// soloist's final-stage `weight *= 2.0` multiplier biases toward color tones,
// not toward roots/3rds/5ths which already win via the chord-tone bonus.

/**
 * BAND-WIDE POCKET PALETTE (#1005) — the single per-genre micro-timing authority.
 *
 * A "pocket" is a FIXED time offset (seconds, ± around the beat) that the whole
 * melodic band (bass, comper/chords, harmony, soloist) leans by RELATIVE to the
 * drum grid. Positive = behind the beat (laid-back drag); negative = on top /
 * ahead (driving push). Keyed by `groove.genreFeel`, NOT the picker name — see
 * the GENRE-NAMING AUTHORITY block in `data/smart-genres.ts` (`feelToCanon` /
 * `canonToFeel`) for the two keyspaces and how to translate between them.
 *
 * WHY this is the single source of truth: before #1005 each lane carried its own
 * scattered feel constant (bass +5 ms, comp +4 ms, harmony a Neo-Soul-only +20 ms)
 * and the soloist wasn't pocket-locked at all — so "the band's pocket" wasn't
 * provably one value. Now every melodic lane — soloist included since #1025 — adds
 * `getBandPocket(genreFeel)`, so the whole band leans by ONE per-genre amount.
 * (The band-global groove pocket that once layered underneath was deleted in
 * #1063 — a uniform whole-band shift is inaudible by construction; see
 * docs/design/timing-model.md §2/§4.)
 *
 * Metronome-core identity: this is a per-section CONSTANT offset, not tempo
 * breathing/rubato — time stays metronomic; every lane just shares one consistent
 * lean (scaled per section by energy, #1064 — see POCKET_ENERGY_SLOPE below). It
 * is applied to the MELODIC lanes only (not the drum grid), so it's audible as
 * the band sitting behind/ahead of the kit rather than an inaudible global
 * latency.
 *
 * Values are by-ear starting points (July 2026 pocket sweep, owner priority
 * "a consistent pocket the entire band respects"); expect ±few-ms tuning.

 * ENERGY MODULATION of the band lean (#1064) — tier-2 differential, scaled.

 * valid response (timing-model.md §5) is to scale the tier-2 differential itself:
 * section energy AMPLIFIES the genre's timing character. At a chorus/drop the funk
 * band digs in harder ahead of the beat and the neo-soul band leans deeper behind
 * it (laying back deeper at the heavy section is where the weight comes from); in
 * a breakdown/intro everyone plays it straighter, closer to the grid (sparse
 * sections read as tight and intentional). The rejected alternative — everyone
 * migrating toward the grid as energy rises — would evaporate the Dilla drag
 * exactly at the drop.
 *
 * Slope 0.8 over energy ∈ [0,1] centered on 0.5 → scale ∈ [0.6, 1.4]: ±40% of the
 * palette value at the extremes, and EXACTLY 1.0 at verse/default energy so
 * label-less chords, default charts, and every pre-#1064 fixture keep the palette

 *
 * Scope: this bounds the TIER-2 POCKET TERM only. Tier-3 lane character stacks
