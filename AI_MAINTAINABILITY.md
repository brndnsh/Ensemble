# AI Maintainability Assessment

## January 2026 Post-Refactor Review
**Date:** January 28, 2026
**Score:** 96/100 (Exceptional)

### Executive Summary
The "Ensemble" codebase is exceptionally well-structured for AI agents. Following the UI Refactor of January 2026, the application has moved from imperative DOM manipulation to a **declarative, component-based Preact architecture**. This transition has significantly reduced code complexity, eliminated redundant DOM management, and improved state synchronization reliability.

### Detailed Scoring

#### 1. Context & Documentation (20/20)
*   **Strengths:**
    *   `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTS.md` provide clear operational boundaries.
    *   State is split into 6 domain-specific slices (`state/playback.js`, etc.), reducing noise during state refactors.
    *   `UI_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` documents the component migration strategy.

#### 2. Modularity & Architecture (20/20)
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Component-Based UI:** UI logic is encapsulated in Preact components within `public/components/`. This allows agents to modify isolated parts of the interface (e.g., `Transport.jsx`, `SequencerGrid.jsx`) without global side effects.
    *   **Hybrid State Bridge:** `ui-bridge.js` provides a `useEnsembleState` hook that allows components to reactively subscribe to the existing legacy-style state objects.
    *   **Reduced Boilerplate:** `index.html` has been reduced to a simple root container, with most layout logic moved to `App.jsx`.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Some legacy controllers still exist for non-UI logic, but they are increasingly focused on pure engine management.

#### 3. Testing & Verification (20/20)
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Comprehensive test suite (Unit, Integration, Perf, Standards).
    *   UI tests now use `.test.jsx` extensions and verify component behavior via the Preact bridge.

#### 4. Code Consistency (19/20)
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Unified `dispatch(ACTIONS, payload)` pattern across all modules.
    *   Components follow a consistent pattern: selectors for state access, local event handlers for UI-only state, and `dispatch` for global state changes.

#### 5. Dependency Management (19/20) [+1 Improvement]
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Explicit `WORKER_CONTRACT.md` and `worker-types.js` for cross-thread communication.
    *   `esbuild` pipeline handles JSX transformation while keeping build times extremely low.
    *   **New:** Test environment now enables globals (`describe`, `expect`) by default, reducing friction for agents assuming standard Jest/Vitest environments.

### Recommendations for Agents

1.  **UI Modification:** Always look for the relevant component in `public/components/`. Use `App.jsx` only for layout-level changes.
2.  **State Modification:** Never mutate state slices directly. Use the imported `ACTIONS` and the global `dispatch` function from `state.js`.
3.  **UI Synchronization:** When adding new state properties, ensure they are handled in the appropriate reducer (e.g., `playback.js`) and followed by a `dispatch` call to trigger component re-renders.
4.  **Legacy Bridging:** If you need to access a DOM element directly (e.g., for legacy Canvas or 3rd party libs), use a `ref` within a component.
5.  **Hybrid Controller Usage:** Be aware that some complex actions (audio engine start/stop) require importing controllers (e.g., `togglePlay`) rather than just dispatching state actions.
